What is Git ?
**Git** is the most commonly used Version Control System. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a
record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes
the collaborations easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merge into one source.
